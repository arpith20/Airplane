# Computer Graphics Project 
============================

Description
------------

The goal of this game is to fly as far as possible, with only two controls at your
disposal, this is one of those “easy to learn, difficult to master” situations. You’ll first
select a plane and a scene. Click once to start make your little guy take off from an
airport, and it’s on!!

As you fly, right click to begin ascending; the plane descends automatically. So it’s
critical to master this bouncy method of flying.<br/>
Missiles of varying sizes are shot at you. So, you’ll spend most of your time avoiding
these. Keep a close eye at the fuel gauge! You’ll steadily be running out of fuel as you
try to gain height. Hit a missile, run out of fuel, or fly into the bottom edge of the
screen, and you’ll crash and burn!

As far as the game interface is concerned, you’ll be greeted with a loading screen
followed by a splash screen with the name of the developers (that’s Arpith and Anil!).
You’ll then see a menu with screen with the following items:<br/>
• Play<br/>
• Settings<br/>
• Instructions<br/>
• Credits<br/>
• High Scores<br/>
• Exit<br/>

The user can either start the game directly, if he knows how the game works or has
played it before, by clicking in the box with “Play” option. Otherwise, he can view the
instruction as to the game works by clicking on the “Instruction” button. If the player
has changed his mind to play the game sometime later, he can click on “Exit” button
which terminates the game.

When the player hits on the Instruction button, another page which describes how the
game works appears. Similarly, credits page will show you the name of the
developers. Setting page will allow you to choose the plane and environment scene of
your wish. Pressing escape at any point of time will bring you to the main page.

This easy to play game can be further developed to include new features. You may
unlock new planes as you progress through the game. Each plane may have its own
ability from getting invisible or using time warp to a powerful explosive power.
Players may left click on the screen to initiate a power-up.
